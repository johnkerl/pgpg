# pgpg

PGPG is the Pretty Good Parser Generator. As of Feburary 2023 it is very much a sketch and a work in progress.

Goals:

* Implement a few basic algorithms.
* Reuse code whenever possible.
* Make good use of classes -- e.g. `lexer.match()` rather than global `match()`.
* Be lucid above all else. Lexing/parsing is ubiquitous in the modern world, and forms a large part of our world. Yet sadly such tools are arcane and confusing. PGPG is transparent, inclusive, and explains itself openly.
